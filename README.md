## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model for forecasting taxi trip demand in New York City. The model aims to:

- Accurately predict the number of taxi pickups for specific locations and time periods
- Estimate pickup and dropoff locations based on historical patterns
- Utilize various features including date, time, and geographical data

By achieving these objectives, the project seeks to:

1. Improve the matching of available taxis with customer demand
2. Enhance overall traffic management efficiency in NYC
3. Provide valuable insights for taxi companies and city planners
